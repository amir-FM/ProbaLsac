# Poll_IT

## Installation

**git clone** repo<br>
**npm install** in *frontend* and *backend* directories

## Description

A poll website, that let's user vote their favourite options.<br>
It features a state of the art bearly functional frontend and a quite complete backend.<br>
For the project I used the **React Framework** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **MongoDB** for the backend and database.<br> 
At the start of the project the only thing i knew about web development was some basic html and css. This project gave me the opportunity to learn how to use new tools. Now that I finished the project (or rather that the deadline came) I can say the backend was by far easier to implement.<br>
The features that I have implemented are usable and mostly stable.<br>
Overall this project was a great experience, but for me as a novice in *WebDevel* it was really a challange to keep up with the sheer amount of things I had to learn.
